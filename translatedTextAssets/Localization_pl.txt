CAMPAIGN_1_TITLE,"Flight of the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i]"
CAMPAIGN_1_DESCRIPTION,"Following the destruction of the Death Star, you must escape the Empire’s retaliation on Yavin 4 and protect the transport [i]Freedom Fighter[/i] as it passes through treacherous Imperial space."
CAMPAIGN_1_PROLOGUE,"From within the secret Rebel base on Yavin 4, you listen anxiously as the pilots of Red and Gold squadrons face down the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star. You cheer with joyful relief when Luke Skywalker destroys the Imperial installation with a single shot. You stand at grateful attention as Princess Leia Organa presents Skywalker and Han Solo with awards for their meritorious service.\n\nYet, the ceremony has hardly finished when Rebel Command orders a full evacuation of the Yavin 4 base. You help load the transports, uncertain how long you have until the Empire arrives...."
CAMPAIGN_1_VICTORY,"The Rebel ships arrayed at the rendezvous point are a welcome sight. The Alliance has survived the evacuation of the base on Yavin 4 and, thanks to your actions, has escaped detection by Imperial forces. Though you will never forget the cost of this victory, you know it is a small sacrifice for the good you have done. Admiral Ackbar pins commendations to each of your uniforms. You’ve barely had time to thank the admiral for the honor when your comlink beeps—new orders. There are still many battles left to fight before the galaxy is freed of the Emperor’s tyranny, and you may yet be instrumental in them. May the Force be with you, always!"
CAMPAIGN_1_DEFEAT_1,"You awaken in an Imperial detention cell. Your most serious wounds have been tended to, but judging by every other part of your body aching, that’s probably just so that you don’t die before the Empire has had a chance to question you. The door to your cell slides open, and an Imperial intelligence officer enters. “Your crew will be well-treated if you cooperate,” the officer sneers. Almost certainly a lie, perhaps even a bluff. If you don’t give the Empire answers, they will move to the next captive. But you cannot betray the Alliance. As the officer beckons for an interrogation droid, you prepare to resist to your last breath. May the Force be with you…"
CAMPAIGN_1_DEFEAT_2,"You awaken in an Imperial detention cell. Your most serious wounds have been tended to, but judging by every other part of your body aching, that’s probably just so that you don’t die before the Empire has had a chance to question you. The door to your cell slides open, and any hope of a rescue you may have harbored is dashed as an Imperial intelligence officer enters alongside the ominously-humming globe of a hovering interrogation droid. As stormtroopers restrain you, you can only hope that some twist of fate allowed your crew to escape in the chaos you caused. If so, may the Force be with them…"
CAMPAIGN_1_DEFEAT_3,"Your sacrifice bought the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i] time to escape. The last thing you see before collapsing is the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i] streaking away from the Star Destroyer, its engines glimmering against the black of space before rocketing safely into hyperspace. Even the ominous humming of Imperial interrogation droids cannot banish your hope for the galaxy. As an Imperial intelligence officer begins your interrogation, you know this: you have saved many Rebel lives, and you will resist as long as it takes to save more with your silence. You, like the Alliance itself, will not surrender. May the Force be with you…"
CAMPAIGN_1_DEFEAT_4,"Your sacrifice bought the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i] time to escape. The last thing you see before collapsing is the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i] streaking away from the Star Destroyer, its engines glimmering against the black of space before rocketing safely into hyperspace. As Imperial intelligence officers begin their agonizing interrogation, they cannot shatter your determination to resist to the last moment. You saved many Rebel lives, and though you failed to protect the star map from the Empire, the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i]’s crew still have a chance to warn the fleet before the Empire can use that information. Hope survives. May the Force be with them…"
CAMPAIGN_1_DEFEAT_5,"You have overcome everything the Imperial war machine has thrown at you to ensure the safety of the [i]Freedom Fighter[/i], the survival of its crew, and the security of the Rebel Alliance. You feel strangely honored that your exploits proved impressive enough for Darth Vader to personally intervene. Vader’s grip tightens as more Imperial soldiers flood the hangar. “Commander, prepare holding cells for these Rebel agents,” Vader orders. ""We have much to discuss."" You struggle for breath as you start to lose consciousness. For now, you have saved the Rebellion. Even in the face of Darth Vader, you will not surrender. May the Force be with you, always."
